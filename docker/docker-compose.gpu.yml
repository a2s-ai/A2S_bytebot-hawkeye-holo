# GPU Configuration Extension for NVIDIA GPUs
#
# NOTE: As of the latest version, GPU configuration is now included in
# docker-compose.override.yml and loaded automatically. This file is kept
# for backward compatibility but is no longer needed for normal usage.
#
# The default setup now automatically enables GPU if nvidia-container-toolkit
# is available, and gracefully falls back to CPU if not.
#
# This file can still be used if you need custom GPU configuration:
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
#
# Prerequisites:
# - NVIDIA GPU (requires x86_64/amd64 architecture)
# - nvidia-container-toolkit installed
# - NVIDIA drivers installed
